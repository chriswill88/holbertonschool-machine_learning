### **Learning Objectives:**
1. What is a plot? - it is a graphical representation of a data set. A graph showing the relationship between two or more variables
2. What is a scatter plot? - a type of plot using a cartesian plane to plot points of for usually two variables.
3. Line graph? - a graph that draws the relation between a set of points on a cartesian plane tracking the relationship of certain data usually over time.
4. Bar graph? - a graph that represents data with rectangular bars with heights of lengths proportional to the values they represent.
5. Histogram? - an approximate representation of the distribution of numerical or catagorical data
6. What is matplotlib? - a library in python that allows for the user to create graphical interpretations of data
7. How to plot data with matplotlib? - 
8. How to label a plot -
9. How to scale an axis - 
10. How to plot multiple sets of data at the same time -
