# Linear Algebra

### **Description**
This particular project is a intro to the math we are going to use in machine learning and some projects using numpy.

### **Learning Objectives:**
1. What is a vector? - A vector is a direction and magnitude
2. What is a matrix? - A matrix is a series of vectors
3. What is a transpose? - It means to flip a matrix setting the rows as the column and the columns as rows
4. What is the shape of a matrix? - Rectangular
5. What is an axis? - A dimension when using numpy.
6. What is a slice? - A slice is an object containing only a portion of a sequence.
7. How do you slice a vector/matrix? - You can slice a vector/matrix by 
8. What are element-wise operations? - It is ...
9. How do you concatenate vectors/matrices? - It's done by ...
10. What is the dot product? - multiplying corresponding vectors and adding there products together gives you a scalar constant. <img src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/7093a2c642c17b4be8c2765fdc3d223f.png/">
11. What is matrix multiplication? - It is multiplying matrixes together.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things To Remember:
1. Matrix dont have to be the same size
2. Inner dimensions must be eqivilant
3. New size is equal to the outer dimensions of the original matrixes.

12. What is Numpy? it is ...
13. What is parallelization and why is it important? j
14. What is broadcasting?
