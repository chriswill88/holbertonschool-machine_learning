# Linear Algebra

### **Description**
This particular project is a intro to the math we are going to use in machine learning and some projects using numpy.

### **Learning Objectives:**
1. What is a vector? - A vector is a direction and magnitude
2. What is a matrix? - A matrix is a series of vectors
3. What is a transpose? - It means to flip a matrix setting the rows as the column and the columns as rows
4. What is the shape of a matrix? - the dimensions of the matrix
5. What is an axis? - A dimension when using numpy.
6. What is a slice? - A slice is an object containing only a portion of a sequence.
7. How do you slice a vector/matrix? - You can slice a vector/matrix by extracting part of the array into a subset.
8. What are element-wise operations? - They are operations that aplly to elements of a matrix.
9. How do you concatenate vectors/matrices? - It's done by ...
10. What is the dot product? - multiplying corresponding vectors and adding there products together gives you a scalar constant. <img src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/7093a2c642c17b4be8c2765fdc3d223f.png/">
11. What is matrix multiplication? - It is multiplying matrixes together.  
  Things To Remember:
  + Matrix dont have to be the same size  
  + Inner dimensions must be eqivilant  
  + New size is equal to the outer dimensions of the original matrixes.

12. What is Numpy? it is a libray in python adding support for large multi dimensional arrays.
13. What is parallelization and why is it important? 
14. What is broadcasting?
